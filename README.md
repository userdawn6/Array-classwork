#Array-classwork
Algorithm for the code


1. Define a constant maxSize to limit the size of the array to 6.
2. Calculate the effective length n of the array as the minimum of the length of a and maxSize.
3. Create a new array truncatedArray with a length of n.
4. Copy the first n elements from a to truncatedArray.
5. Calculate the effective rotation distance d as d % n.
